# Statistics project

We had a thought that TV shows tend to get worse with the time, this lead us to come up with the following question and conduct the study. It aims to discover **to what extent does a TV series's life-span affect viewer perception for top rated shows**. We implemented a web scraper and collected data from IMDB. We were able to derive and test another related sub-question. We assessed the question using hypothesis testing. We were not able to find any correlation between life-span of the TV show and it's rating. We tend to think there might exist more significant factors that affect viewer-perception which are outside the scope of this study. 

The statistical report can be found [here](https://github.com/zstrox/statistics-project/blob/main/Statistics%20TV%20show%20study.ipynb).
The datascraper itself can be found [here](https://github.com/zstrox/statistics-project/blob/main/imdb_data_scraper.ipynb).
